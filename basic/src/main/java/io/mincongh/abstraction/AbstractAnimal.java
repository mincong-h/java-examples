/**
 * An abstract class is a class which cannot be instantiated. An abstract class is used by creating
 * an inheriting subclass that can be instantiated. An abstract class does a few things for the
 * inheriting subclass:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Define methods which can be used by the inheriting subclass.
 *   <li>Define abstract methods which the inheriting subclass must implement.
 *   <li>Provide a common interface which allows the subclass to be interchanged with all other
 *       subclasses.
 * </ul>
