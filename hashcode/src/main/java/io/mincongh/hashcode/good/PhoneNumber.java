   * <b>Do not be tempted to exclude significant parts of an object from the hash code computation
   * to improve performance.</b> While the resulting hash function may run faster, its poor quality
   * may degrade hash tables' performance to the point where they become unusably slow. In
   * particular, the hash function may, in practice, be confronted with a large collection of
   * instances that differ largely in the regions that you've chosen to ignore. If this happens, the
   * hash function will map all the instances to a very few hash codes, and hash-based collections
   * will display quadratic performance. This is not just a theoretical problem. The {@code String}
   * hash function implemented in all releases prior to 1.2 examined at most sixteen characters,
   * evenly spaced throughout the string, starting with the first character. For large collections
   * of hierarchical names, such as URLs, this hash function displayed exactly the pathological
   * behavior noted here.
